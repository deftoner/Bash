[Clean-CSV.sh](Clean-CSV.sh): Little basic linux bash script to process geolocationDatabaseIPv4.csv from *ipapi.is* (https://ipapi.is/data/geolocationDatabaseIPv4.csv.zip), to separate the csv file into smaller pieces by country. Also it delets the column "IP Version" (first columns) since all ips on that DB are IPv4.
